## Operations

This node supports the following Bitrix24 modules and operations:

### Modules

* `crm.company`
* `crm.contact`
* `crm.deal`
* `crm.lead`
* (more coming soon)

### Supported operations per entity:

* **Create** (Add a new entity)
* **Get** (Get an entity by ID)
* **Update** (Update an entity by ID)
* **Delete** (Delete an entity by ID)
* **List** (Query/filter entities)
* **Get Fields Description** (Fetch metadata for custom fields)

Each operation supports:

* **Field-by-field input** or **raw JSON** input
* Filtering, sorting, and field selection for list queries

---

## Credentials

This node supports two authentication methods:

### 1. Bitrix Webhook

Use a webhook URL from Bitrix24 (e.g. `https://yourdomain.bitrix24.ru/rest/1/abc123xyz/`).

To set this up:

* In Bitrix24, go to **Developer tools → Webhooks**
* Create an inbound webhook and select required access
* Copy the webhook URL and use it in credentials

### 2. OAuth2 (Bitrix24 REST API)

If you want to use OAuth2:

* Create an application in Bitrix24
* Use the client ID, secret, and domain in the OAuth2 credential
* Supports automatic token refresh and secure API access

---

## Compatibility

* **Tested on:** `1.92.2`

Known limitations:

* Some custom fields in Bitrix may require extra formatting depending on field type.

---

## Usage

When creating or updating records, you can choose to:

* Fill fields one-by-one (dynamic list of available fields is loaded)
* Or provide the full data in raw JSON

When listing entities, you can:

* Use simple filters (field, operator, value)
* Or provide complex JSON filters (e.g., combined filters, nested conditions)

Field names are loaded dynamically based on selected entity (e.g., `crm.contact`), making it easier to work with custom fields.
